                To bypass this arduous process, an app would be created that would simply scan a piece of ID and import it into the specific file in question.

    <div>

    <div>
        <p class="body">Going into the design process for this application, I knew the only way users would opt to download and use a mobile app rather than manually enter the information into the web application is if it were significantly easier than the existing process. What I did not have control over was the steps involved in opening one's phone, downloading the app and opening it, which are extra steps the users would previously not need to take to verify an ID. This means that the user experience of the application would have to be as simple and straightforward as possible to outweigh what is beyond my control.</p>
    
        <p class="body"><b>I drew the following concept to establish the first ideas about how the user process of LDD Verify would flow.</b></p>
    </div>

    <div style="margin-top: 20px;">
        <p class="section-header">Reviewing the concept</p>
        <p class="header">What worked:</p>
        <p class="body">The simplicity of some aspects, such as the home page which served one function, or the scanning page which was designed to provide basic instructions without distracting from the camera view on screen proved to be a strength of the concept. Some smaller concepts, like automatically matching the scanned identification to a file also became central to the final usability.</p>
    <div>

    <div style="margin-top: 20px;">
        <p class="header">What needed improvement</p>
        <p class="body"><b>Navigation throughout the application:</b> Originally, the concept was split into three distinct pages of access. The home screen, which showed a list of recent scans and actions upon that data; the scan screen, and a setting screen. I came to realize that this was not the right approach for a number of reasons.
            For one, since scanning was the primary function of the app, it should be entrenched into the initial view in a far more clear way, having it on a separate navigation screen would provide several difficulties. For example, though the camera view is the first screen in the scanning process, it isn’t the only, and showing another screen subsequently opens up the opportunity of the user becoming confused.
            Additionally, the settings screen had no reason to be a primary navigation item as it would be rarely used, a far more apt position would be in a hamburger menu in the top left. This way, the functionality exists without adding unnecessary screens.
            Finally, though the app at the point of development has only one function, it may down the road grow to include more tools, and dedicating a bottom navigation to just one function would create limitations and new problems preventing growth of the app.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
            <b>Adding to a file:</b> Though the matched file functionality was a strength of the application from the beginning, users may still need to add manually if the same client has multiple files with the law firm. Therefore, a list with a search function must appear. The original design had this search function underneath the matched file. However, the search field is always at the top of our web applications and the same principle should be applied to the mobile app.

        <p class="body">LDD Mobile Verify was designed in less than two weeks. Because of this, little research was able to be conducted, and this app's process could best be described as a sprint. Nonetheless, I believe that my process for LDD Mobile Verify made the process of scanning identification items as simple as it possibly could be.</p>
