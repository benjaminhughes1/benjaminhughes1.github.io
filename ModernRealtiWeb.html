            <p class="body">
                Since it's launch in the early 2000s, RealtiWeb has been a favourite conveyancing software for Canadian legal professionals. As an enterprise software, RealtiWeb has been used by legal professionals as a daily tool. However, a wave of new users has demanded vastly different user needs than the legacy group. <b>Updating RealtiWeb quickly became a challenge of satisfying long time users while meeting the needs of new customers.</b>

            <p class="body">
                The creators of RealtiWeb had been aware of the two user group issue for some time, and as a solution, had built a platform known internally as "NewDev". However, NewDev was built without any user research being done and though the interface was visually pleasing, the project ultimately had to be scrapped. Upon joining the organization, I established the basis of user research that new projects would go forward operating on.

            <p class="body">
                Starting the research process, I made a survey available to our users. This would both establish some basic quantitative research as well as help source users to host detailed interviews with. Interviewing users of varying relations to our application allowed for a distinct understanding of of our users needs and provided a basis for improvements made to our system.

            <p class="body">
                The interviews exposed the vast differences between RealtiWeb's user groups. The contrasting user needs suggested that a new program should be created to satisfy the demands of new users, the existing system should also be continously updated to satisfy both long-time users, and those that might expect updates, but not those as drastic as a new platform would introduce.

            <p class="header">The New Platform</p>
            <p class="body width-full-mobile">One of the problems I believed led to the scrapping of the previous "New-Dev" project was that it overlooked many of the strengths of the legacy system while misunderstanding the weaknesses to be addressed.</p>

            <p class="body width-full-mobile">For example, one of the strengths of the legacy system my research uncovered was the simplicity of the data entry aspect. Fields are presented in a clear and concise way for the users to understand. On the other hand, one of the major weaknesses that the new-dev failed to address was navigation within a file, which was a priority to be addressed in the creation of a new platform</p>

        <div class="column">
            <p class="header">The Legacy Platform</p>
            <p class="body">Over the course of a year, gradual changes were made to the legacy RealtiWeb platform. The priority of this was subtle design cleanups that would maintain the familiar patterns that our users are accustomed to. This route allowed us to satisfy modern design standards while maintaining the accessibility and ease of use of our long-time users.</p>

            <p class="body">This approach was crucial to easing new design language to existing users, and was a viable option for users that do not directly fall into either user group and may have established some familiarity with the existing system.</p>

            <p class="body width-full-mobile">Enforcing a new approach of research-driven solutions resulted in product design and UX going from one of RealtiWeb's major weaknesses to a distinct strength of the platform. The two system approach effectively satisfies all user groups and has had a positive effect not only on the user's experience, but RealtiWeb's marketing, sales, and support initiatives.</p>

                <p class="body">There is quite a bit more that could have been done to improve the system. Though multiple rounds of interviews and surveys were conducted over the course of a year and half, there are various other research types that would have been useful. However, for a team of two responsible for the research, design, and coding of the new enhancements, I am proud of what has been accomplished.</p>
